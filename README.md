# Multimodal-Bracelet
This project provides electrical and mechanical plans such as all software to build a multimodal bracelet that can be used to acquire muscular activity. The bracelet is designed around the commercial Avanti Trigno EMG sensors by Delsys. We combine each EMG sensor with 4 FMG sensors (FSRs). That way each module can acquire EMG and IMU data by the Avanti Trigno sensors and FMG. The following Figure shows how we combined the multiple modalities in a single module.

The pictures below shall help to get a better understanding about the design of the bracelet and shall help when replicating the device.
